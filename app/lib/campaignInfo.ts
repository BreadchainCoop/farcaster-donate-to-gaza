      title: 'Who does my donation support?',
      content: `Your money is going to the family of Ibrahim, a 26 year old tourism manager originally from Gaza city, currently displaced with his family in Dier al Balah. Ibrahim recently got married this summer and he and his wife are expecting their first child. In addition to his new family, Ibrahim is responsible for supporting his extended family of 26 people, including elders, children, and a disabled adult. These fundraising efforts are the family's sole source of income to cover food, rent, medicine, and everything else. Our fundraising group is entirely volunteer and we send 100% of your donation to Ibrahim. We are in daily communication with him to try our best to meet the family's needs.`
    },
    {
      title: 'What can I do to help?',
      content: `We are a small group of precariously employed and low income people, and we are not able to cover the financial costs of this work alone. We appreciate every offer of support! Talk to your people about this campaign. Make concrete requests of your friends and family. Everyone who contributes in even the smallest way to this work helps us keep going, and every donor that you can help us recruit - especially if you can sign folks up for recurring donations* - helps us immensely. We regularly organize different types of fundraising events that you can support with whatever your availability allows.
      
*this is an option on our Chuffed Euro account, ask if you need help setting it up`
    },
    {
      title: 'How much do you need to raise?',
      content: `As you probably have heard, the price of goods in Gaza has increased to unimaginable levels over the last two years. Like the majority of the population, Ibrahim's family has no source of income to offset these costs, and no family outside of Gaza to subsidize them. Therefore, they rely entirely on this fundraising group for all their daily needs. Currently, to feed 27 people an extremely basic diet costs €150/day. In addition to around €900 for monthly rent, this means we need to raise about €5500/month.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Why are you still asking for donations when on the Chuffed account it shows that you have surpassed the goal already?',
      content: `The Chuffed account shows the total turnover of the campaign since it was created, not the current account balance. This means you can't tell by looking at the public Chuffed page how much is actually in the account. We transfer money from this account to Ibrahim daily, so if we are asking for donations, it means there is no money currently in the account.`
    },
    {
      title: 'How does the money get to Gaza?',
      content: `We are sending all donations directly to Ibrahim via crypto transfer (USDT Tron). We convert the donations to USDT and transfer them to Ibrahim's crypto wallet. He then goes to a trading desk or merchant near him who will buy cryptocurrency and exchanges it for cash. For this service, the merchant charges a 40% commission - this rate has been steadily increasing over the last two years.

The advantage of using crypto is that we can transfer money immediately, and there are more points of access to make the exchange rather than searching for an operating bank branch. Bank transfers can come with additional risks to access the funds, take a very long time, and also have the same 40% commission rate.`
    },
    {
      title: 'I heard crypto is bad/I disagree ideologically with using crypto.',
      content: `We are using cryptocurrency as a tool to circumvent more dangerous and slower methods of money transfer. Using this method of transfer allows us to avoid the risk of governments or companies freezing bank accounts (there have been many issues sending money to Gaza from German bank accounts, for example). Sending money this way was a request from Ibrahim. We trust those bearing the heaviest weight of this genocide to know what is best for them.`
    },
    {
      title: 'I don\'t like that idea that so much of my donation is going towards commission fees. Isn\'t there a better alternative?',
      content: `Neither do we, and we wish that there were more options. The alternative is an end to the siege and and end to the occupation. On our end, we have tried to develop a system that saves as much on transaction fees as possible, but we cannot change the 40% commission rate being charged in Gaza - this is a fixed commission when withdrawing cash, regardless of the method of money transfer. As Ibrahim writes, everyone must pay this, or die of hunger.`
    },
    {
      title: 'I heard no aid is entering Gaza at all - what are people eating?',
      content: `Since the beginning of March, the occupation has imposed a complete blockade of the Gaza strip, including all food aid. Right now, access to food varies greatly depending on where exactly you are in Gaza. In Deir al Balah, there is still limited food available to buy, but it is very basic and very expensive. There is almost no meat available and fish is incredibly expensive. Currently Ibrahim's family lives on bulgur and thin stew with a few vegetables. A kilo of flour costs $45. Chicken, when they can find it, is $100 for one chicken. If we are unable to raise enough money for their daily food needs, they would have to rely on community food kitchens which are vastly under-resourced.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Why do you have to buy food at all, can\'t people get humanitarian aid for free?',
      content: `The free food available is insufficient to cover everyone's needs, leaving many hungry, and can be extremely dangerous to access. There are some community food kitchens operating, but due to the ongoing blockade, there is not nearly enough to meet the extreme need and people are starving. The barbaric and inhumane "food distribution points" set up by the so-called "Gaza Humanitarian Fund" are death traps where people are routinely slaughtered while trying to secure food for their families.`
    },
    {
      title: 'People are really paying rent during a genocide?',
      content: `Yes. While many are living in tents, Ibrahim's family is lucky to still have access to an apartment in Dier al Balah, which they rent from a landlord. The apartment is located in one of the evacuation red zones, but the family feels it is still safer than moving to tents in one of the so-called "safe zones", which are also constantly under bombardment by the occupation. They have a relatively good relationship with the landlord, who is renting them the apartment at below market rate. The landlord is also Gazan and uses this income to support his family as well.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Wouldn\'t it be better to donate to large organizations rather than individual families?',
      content: `We would like to challenge those giving to question why it is they might feel more comfortable donating to large organizations with name recognition, without intimate knowledge of how that money is actually spent, or personal involvement beyond a one time transaction.

While there are some reputable and Gazan lead initiatives operating on the ground, we believe it is most important to put money directly into the hands of those in Gaza struggling to survive this genocide, as they are the ones who know their needs the best. In this way you can be certain that the highest percentage of your donation possible goes directly to keeping people alive, not to staff salaries, infrastructure overheads, government lobbying or inflated marketing campaigns.

At this time, larger organizations and NGO's do not have special access for bringing food into Gaza - all food aid is currently being blocked by the occupation. Anyone who is distributing food in Gaza is also paying the market rate for what is currently available. This means that when you donate to a large organization, in addition to the same commission rates and high prices everyone in Gaza is subjected to, a large % of your donation is also going to cover salaries and other NGO business expenses.

Given the current commission rates and extremely high food costs, at the moment it is beyond our capacity to provide for more than Ibrahim's immediate family group. However, in the past when we've been able to raise more money than is required to cover the family's daily needs, Ibrahim has bought additional food himself and organized free neighbourhood food distributions. He is very passionate about being able to do this as often as possible, and we would love to be able to help him continue that work.`

    {
      title: 'Is there somewhere I can verify this campaign for myself? Like an Instagram account or see videos of Ibrahim and his family?',
      content: `Like many Gazans, Ibrahim's account was shut down by Instagram. We would like to push back against the expectation that Gazans must share the intimate details of their lives and their suffering in order to be believeable and earn donations from a sympathetic audience.`
    },
    {
      title: 'But then how do I know this isn\'t a scam?',
      content: `Ibrahim is a personal contact of one of the members of our Berlin-based fundraising group. We are working to build a network of supporters for his family through our own local mutual aid networks and associated networks of trust which have existed for years prior. As such, this is not only a request for your donation, it is equally an invitation to be part of the larger work of building interconnected communities of support and solidarity. Come meet us and get involved.`
